This Project is the solution of the following Question.

Q44. Develop a scheduler which submits processes to the processor in the following scenario and compute the scheduler performance by providing the waiting time for process, turnaround time for process and average waiting time and turnaround time.
Considering the arrival time and burst time requirement of the process the scheduler schedules the processes by interrupting the processor after every 6 units of time and does consider the completion of the process in this iteration. The scheduler then checks for the number of process waiting for the processor and allots the processor to the process but interrupting the processor every 10 unit of time and considers the completion of the processes in this iteration. The scheduler checks the number of processes waiting in the queue for the processor after the second iteration and gives the processor to the process which needs more time to complete than the other processes to go in the terminated state.
